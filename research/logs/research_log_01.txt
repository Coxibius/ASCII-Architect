📘 RESEARCH LOG 01: PROJECT ASCII-ARCHITECT (GENESIS & EVOLUTION)
Date: December 14, 2025
Version: V18-Beta (Expansion Phase)
Status: ✅ Base Experts (Box/Arrow) | 🔄 New Experts Training | 🚧 Advanced Routing Pending
Previous Context: Evolution from "Stickman V17" to "ASCII-ARCHITECT".
=========================================================================

1. STRATEGIC PIVOT & EXPANSION
-------------------------------
Validation of "Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic" architecture confirmed that "AI is the mason (draws), Python is the architect (measures)."
We are now expanding beyond simple "Boxes & Arrows" to support full UML/ER capabilities.

2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (V18+ STANDARD)
------------------------------------------
A hybrid token system is standardized ensuring geometric precision.

A. The Dictionary:
   - Structural: <Lxx> (Line Index) + [S:xx] (Mathematical Spacing).
   - Visual: ░ (Canvas/Alpha) + +, -, | (Borders).
   - Logical (Anchors): N, S, E, W (Cardinal points for auto-connection).
   - Semantic: [TYPE:BOX|DIAMOND|CYLINDER], [STYLE:SOLID], [DIM:WxH], [LEN:x].

B. The Experts (Small Language Models - GPT-2):
   [Legacy/Stable]
   1. Expert_Box: Rectangular containers.
   2. Expert_Arrow: Directional flow lines.
   
   [New/In-Training]
   3. Expert_Diamond: Decision nodes (`/\`) for Flowcharts.
   4. Expert_Cylinder: Storage nodes (`( )`) for ER Diagrams/Databases.

3. DATA ENGINEERING MILESTONES
-------------------------------
A. Synthetic Data Generation (The Factories):
   - `factory_boxes.py`: 5,000 samples (Done).
   - `factory_arrows.py`: 5,000 samples (Done).
   - [NEW] `factory_diamonds.py`: 5,000 samples generated. Rhombic inputs for decisions.
   - [NEW] `factory_cylinders.py`: 5,000 samples generated. Database shapes with lids.

B. Model Status:
   - Box & Arrow: deployed and functional (Local Inference).
   - Diamond & Cylinder: Datasets ready for training. (These replace any previous interim attempts).

4. CURRENT INVENTORY (LOCAL DEPLOYMENT)
----------------------------------------
Directory Structure:
/ASCII-Architect
    /models/ASCII_Architect_V1_Models/ 
        /expert_box/   (Active)
        /expert_arrow/ (Active)
    /datasets/         
        dataset_boxes.jsonl
        dataset_arrows.jsonl
        dataset_diamonds.jsonl (READY)
        dataset_cylinders.jsonl (READY)
    /src/              
        engine.py      (V18 Inference Engine)
        router.py      (Linear Routing Logic)

5. IMMEDIATE ROADMAP (PHASE 3: COMPLEX ROUTING)
-----------------------------------------------
The "Manhattan Routing" challenge.
1. The New Experts:
   - Train `Expert_Diamond` and `Expert_Cylinder` on Kaggle GPUs.
   
2. The Manhattan Router:
   - Upgrade `router.py` to support "Elbows" (L-shapes).
   - Logic: `ManhattanWalker` to calculate pathfinding between (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
   - Strategy: Hybrid approach -> Use generated straight lines + Python-injected corners (`+`).

3. Cardinality:
   - Post-processing hooks to turn simple arrows (`>`) into Crow's Foot (`----|<`) for ER diagrams.
