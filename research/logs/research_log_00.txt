RESEARCH LOG 01: PROJECT TERMINAL-GOD (ASCII-ARCHITECT)
Date: December 14, 2025
Version: V18-Alpha (Engineering Focus)
Status: ✅ Project Structure Created | ✅ Box Generator Validated
==========================================================

1. STRATEGIC PIVOT
------------------
Following the success of Stickman V17 (Hybrid Architecture), the decision was made to pivot towards an industrial-grade tool: ASCII-Architect. The goal is to provide developers with an engine to generate technical diagrams (Cloud, DB, Git) directly in the terminal.

2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (V18 STANDARD)
----------------------------------------
The "Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic" engine is maintained:
- Neural: GPT-2 Small (Experts in 2D geometry).
- Symbolic: Python Orchestrator (Coordinate assembly and Snapping).

New Dictionary Standards:
- Structural: <Lxx> (Line) and [S:xx] (Horizontal space).
- Visual: ░ (Transparency/Canvas) and Primitives (+, -, |).
- Logical (Anchors): N, S, E, W (Cardinal points for arrow connection).

3. DEVELOPMENT STATUS
---------------------
- Factory_Boxes.py: COMPLETED. Generates 5,000 dynamic box samples (5x3 to 20x10) with mathematical anchors.
- Tokenization: Usage of [DIM:WxH] defined so the AI understands scale.
- Text Logic: Text injection is delegated to the Python Orchestrator to ensure 1:1 typographic precision.

4. NEXT STEPS
-------------
- Train Expert_Box (V18) on Kaggle.
- Develop Factory_Arrows.py (The challenge of diagonals and flow).
- Implement Canvas.py (The 2D matrix that will allow moving boxes without breaking the ASCII).

"The future of technical documentation is lightweight, fast, and ASCII."
